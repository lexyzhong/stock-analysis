# 2017 & 2018 Stock Analyses with Refractored VBA Script
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to refractor the original script in order to efficiently analyze stock performance by only looping thorugh the entire dataset once. Doing so will allow for the code to run faster, thereby allowing for it to be repurposed for large datasets. 

## Results
